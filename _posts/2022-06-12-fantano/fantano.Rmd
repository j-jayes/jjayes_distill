## Introduction

Anthony Fantano is [the internet's busiest music nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCLwyNT25bU). He has been described [in the New York Times as](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/arts/music/anthony-fantano-the-needle-drop.html):

<blockquote>

The Only Music Critic Who Matters (if Youâ€™re Under 25)

This question can be framed as a regression problem -- the score Fantano rates an album is the outcome variable, and the words that he uses in the review are predictors.

## Don't bury the lede

Here are the words I found that Fantano uses 


## Next steps

I really want to create an interactive widget that lets you describe and album and provide some attributes and then predicts the score that Fantano would give.

It would be really fun to use Shapley values as a way to highlight what variables are important in the prediction. I could perhaps use a huggingface transformer model instead of my simple logistic regression model?

## Process (if you're interested)

The remainder of this post discusses how I collected the data and
