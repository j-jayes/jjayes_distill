We evaluated three alternative statistical approaches where alert thresholds are based on recent data in both temperate and subtropical regions.Methods We compared time series, regression, and cumulative sum (CUSUM) models on empirical data from Hong Kong and the US using a composite index (range = 0–1) consisting of the key outcomes of sensitivity, specificity, and time to detection (lag). The index was calculated based on alarms generated within the first 2 or 4 weeks of the peak season.Results We found that the time series model was optimal in the Hong Kong setting, while both the time series and CUSUM models worked equally well on US data. For alarms generated within the first 2 weeks (4 weeks) of the peak season in Hong Kong, the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.77 (0.86); regression 0.75 (0.82); CUSUM 0.56 (0.75). In the US data the maximum values of the index were: time series 0.81 (0.95); regression 0.81 (0.91); CUSUM 0.90 (0.94).Conclusions Automated influenza surveillance methods based on short-term data, including time series and CUSUM models, can generate sensitive, specific, and timely alerts, and can offer a useful alternative to Serfling-like methods that rely on long-term, historically based thresholds.}",

abstract = {The 1918 influenza – the Spanish flu – killed an estimated 6% of South Africans. Not all were equally affected. Mortality rates were particularly high in districts with a large share of black and coloured residents. To investigate why this happened, we transcribed 39,482 death certificates from the Cape Province. Using a novel indicator – whether a doctor’s name appears on the death certificate – we argue that the unequal health outcomes were a consequence of unequal access to healthcare. Our results show that the racial inequalities in health outcomes that existed before October 1918 were exacerbated during the pandemic. Access to healthcare, as we expected, worsened for black and coloured residents of the Cape Province. Unexpectedly, however, we found that other inequalities were unchanged, or even reversed, notably age, occupation and location. Living in the city, for instance, became a health hazard rather than a benefit during the pandemic. These surprising results contradict the general assumption that all forms of inequality are exacerbated during a crisis. Our analyses suggest explanations for the widening racial gap in healthcare access during the 1918 pandemic, from both the demand and the supply side. We could find, however, no evidence of racial prejudice. Our findings confirm the importance of taking race into account in studying the effects of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic or other world crises.}

Especially, it can help the multidomain applications in a big data environment. However, the support vector machine is mathematically complex and computationally expensive. The main objective of this chapter is to simplify this approach using process diagrams and data flow diagrams to help readers understand theory and implement it successfully. To achieve this objective, the chapter is divided into three parts: (1) modeling of a linear support vector machine; (2) modeling of a nonlinear support vector machine; and (3) Lagrangian support vector machine algorithm and its implementations. The Lagrangian support vector machine with simple examples is also implemented using the R programming platform on Hadoop and non-Hadoop systems.",

@article{Shanks2010,
abstract = {The very large difference in mortality rates between Kimberley diamond miners and Witwatersrand gold miners during the 1918 influenza pandemic has never been explained. We examined extant epidemiological records from South African mining operations and other related activities to determine if mortality risk factors could be measured. During October 1918 when pandemic influenza struck in South Africa, the mortality rates in Kimberley diamond miners (22.4{\%}, n = 11 445) were {\textgreater}35 times that of Rand gold miners (0.6{\%}, n = 200 000). There were no differences discernable between diamond and gold miners regarding their recruitment, working conditions, housing or medical care that would explain the great variance in mortality rates. Reports of influenza-like illness in Natal Province some weeks prior to the main pandemic suggest infection from a mild version of influenza and thus protection of the gold miners from mortality whereas the more isolated diamond miners only experienced the second, more lethal, wave. The huge mortality difference between South African diamond and gold miners in 1918 is most likely explained by the circulation of a related but not identical virus to the A/H1N1 pandemic strain which reached Johannesburg prior to October 1918 because of its better transportation connections. {\textcopyright} 2009 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

@article{Bogaert2015,
abstract = {Objectives: This research analyses morbidity and mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic among Ontario soldiers in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). This paper asks: did exposure to influenza during the first wave confer protection against illness and death during the second wave of the pandemic? Methods: Pneumonia and influenza (P{\&}I) cases and deaths among Ontario soldiers were transcribed from the 1918 Admission and Discharge books for the CEF. Following the methods of Barry et al. [10], hospital admission and mortality rates for P{\&}I were compared for new recruits ({\textless}1 month service) and seasoned soldiers ({\textgreater}1 month service) in order to assess the possibility of cross protection during successive waves of the pandemic. Results: The first wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic occurred between March and May of 1918, with the second wave erupting from September to December. Mortality in the second wave was more severe, with a case fatality rate of 4.7{\%}, which was more than double the rate of 2.3{\%} from March to May. Seasoned soldiers experienced 82.5{\%} protection from illness due to P{\&}I illness in the fall, and 84{\%} protection from death. Conclusions: The morbidity data for the soldier population of Ontario, data unavailable for civilians, confirms the presence of a herald wave in Ontario. The findings support the hypothesis that exposure to influenza during the first wave of the pandemic had a protective effect during the second more deadly wave in the fall. Regional heterogeneity characterized the pandemic among soldiers in Ontario. Conscription practices may have funnelled vulnerable recruits, such as rural farmers, into training camps after the first wave of the pandemic, but prior to the second wave.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19's potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.},

Many questions about its origins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health implications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt even as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a pandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new information about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example, sequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tissues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide answers to some critical questions.

abstract = {Background. The current worst-case scenario for pandemic influenza planning is based on the catastrophic 1918-1919 pandemic. In this article, we examine the strength of cross-protection between successive waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic, which has remained a long-standing issue of debate. Method. We studied monthly hospitalization and mortality rates for respiratory illness in 37 army camps, as well as the rates of repeated episodes of influenza infection during January-December 1918 in 8 military and civilian settings in the United States and Britain. Results. A first wave of respiratory illness occurred in US Army camps during March-May 1918 and in Britain during May-June, followed by a lethal second wave in the fall. The first wave was characterized by high morbidity but had a lower fatality rate than the second wave (1.1{\%} vs. 4.7{\%} among hospitalized soldiers; P {\textless} .001). Based on repeated illness data, the first wave provided 35{\%}-94{\%} protection against clinical illness during the second wave and 56{\%}-89{\%} protection against death (P {\textless} .001). Conclusion. Exposure to influenza in the spring and summer of 1918 provided mortality and morbidity protection during the fall pandemic wave. The intensity of the first wave may have differed across US cities and countries and may partly explain geographical variation in pandemic mortality rates in the fall. Pandemic preparedness plans should consider that immune protection could be naturally acquired during a first wave of mild influenza illnesses. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

In order to refine the verification of the fetal origins hypothesis, we tried not only to focus on children from elite schools but also to construct the continuous influenza mortality measure using monthly variations in the number of births and influenza deaths. By utilizing a nationwide multidimensional physical examination dataset, we found that fetal exposure to influenza in the pandemic years reduced the heights of boys and girls by approximately 0.3 cm and 0.1 cm, respectively. While the strongest negative magnitude was observed in the pandemic period, the lingering relapses in the post-pandemic period still had considerable adverse effects on height. In relation to the lowest decile group which experienced normal influenza mortality in non-pandemic years, the heights of the boys and girls who experienced pandemic influenza in the womb are approximately 0.6 and 0.3 cm lower. The lingering influenza relapse in the post-pandemic period has an adverse effect on the boys' height, accounting for roughly 80{\%} of the maximum pandemic effect.},

The analysis combines a panel dataset on infant and all-age mortality with a novel measure of air pollution based on the burning of coal in a large sample of U.S. cities. We estimate that air pollution contributed significantly to pandemic mortality. Cities that used more coal experienced tens of thousands of excess deaths in 1918 relative to cities that used less coal with similar pre-pandemic socioeconomic conditions and baseline health. Factors related to poverty, public health, and the timing of onset also affected pandemic mortality. The findings support recent medical evidence on the link between air pollution and influenza infection, and suggest that poor air quality was an important cause of mortality during the pandemic.},
