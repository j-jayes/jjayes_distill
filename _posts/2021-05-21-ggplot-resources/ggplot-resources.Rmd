## Purpose

Data visualisation is super fun and a great tool for communication. I have put together [some slides](https://j-jayes.github.io/data-viz-workshop/) for talk on data visualisation for economic historians at the [Laboratory for the Economics of Africa's Past](https://leapstellenbosch.org.za/). These resources are collected here to help when you think 'where do I start?'.

I hope that you find these resources useful. They are divided up into different sections in the tabs below.

### Why use R?

There are a multitude of different pieces of software and different workflows that you can use to create beautiful and intelligible data visualizations.

I think R is a very good choice. There are three reasons I love R for data viz.

1. `ggplot2` is a fantastic library for making data visualizations - it is customizable and logical. 
2. The [R community](https://twitter.com/rstatstweet?lang=en) is very supportive and makes learning and improving a pleasure.
3. The entire process of importing and cleaning data, visualizing it, and then sharing it is made easy in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

## Resources

In the tabs below, I have collected some resources that I hope you will find useful!

# Videos and textbooks for learning how to use R

The definitive guide to using R in a modern manner is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. I am not sure that is the best place to start, but it is certinaly a helpful resource to come back to.

![The R for Data Science textbook](images/r4ds.png)

I am a visual learner and as a conseqeunce I like to watch how things are done and copy them. Because Youtube allows for pausing and recapping at your own pace, I think this is a great way to learn. I've collected some videos in these resources which I think are a good place to start.

[David Robinson's Youtube Channel](https://youtu.be/tCa2di7aEP4)

David Robinson does a weekly screencast where he shows how to do exploratory data analysis and makes plots in R.

Here is a video about analysing text from reviews of ramen noodles. It has some useful tips for drawing tie-fighter plots and interpreting linear regressions.

[Julia Silge's blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/hawaii-post-offices/)

Julia Silge's blog is mostly about doing modelling in R, and text modelling in particular. It is a very useful place to look if you want to understand the tidymodels framework which provides access to a host of machine learning techniques in a very easy to use manner. She also has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA5SyY-s-AA&feature=emb_imp_woyt)

[The tidy text mining textbook](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

Written by Julia Silge and David Robinson, this book gives a lovely introduction to text mining in R. It has lots of examples and includes all the code necessary. As a bonus it is free!

[Datasets]{.panel-name}

# Useful sources of data to practice your skills on

Having great datasets available helps to keep me interested in learning new skills. Here are three sources of interesting data:

[The Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

Tidy Tuesday is a project run by the R for Data Science foundation - each week they share a real world data set and encourage R users to practice their skills. It has a really fantastic community aspect and if you share your work on Twitter people are always helpful and kind. Others share their work and their code so you can see how their plots were made.
In their words, 
<blockquote>
The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions.
</blockquote>

[Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)

"Data is Plural is a weekly newsletter of useful/curious datasets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine". This sums it up - really interesting stuff from all over the internet.

![Data is plural](images/data-is-plural.PNG)

[Naked Data](https://nakeddata.org/)

"Naked Data is a weekly newsletter which rounds up the best in data-driven storytelling created in or about the Global South." Get the best bits of twitter without having to spend all day scrolling. Really great newsletter based in SA.

[Visualization]{.panel-name}

# Great places to get inspiration, figures and code from

The [Storytelling with Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog) blog has an excellent selection of articles that give tips and tricks on how to design graphics that are easy to understand.

Their [Chart Guide](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/chart-guide) is also a fantastic starting point for how to pick a chart.

![SWD Chart Guide](images/swd-guide.PNG)

[Clause Wilke's Course on Data Visualization in R](https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/syllabus.html) is perhaps the definitive course on data viz in R. The description reads:

<blockquote cite="https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/syllabus.html">
In this class, students will learn how to visualize data sets and how to reason about and communicate with data visualizations. A substantial component of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in R. In addition, students will learn how to compile analyses and visualizations into reports, how to make the reports reproducible, and how to post reports on a website or blog.
</blockquote>

[Jonathan Tan's exploration of Household Solar Energy in the US](https://jtanwk.github.io/us-solar/) is an amazing data storytelling piece that shows all of the code required to create each figure. It makes great use of annotations to explain each component of the visualizations. 

![Jonathan Tan's ggridge plot](images/jonathan-tan.PNG)

[The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) is a useful website which showcases different kinds of visualizations and provides the code that you need to use to recreate the figure yourself.

# If you're interested in learning more about how to make your charts look great.

[William Chase's talk on 'The Glamour of Graphics'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cTacaWE6I) is a fantastic resource on choosing colours and how to make your graphs pop.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5cTacaWE6I?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Stephen Tracy's breakdown of [DataViz Sins You Should Never Commit](https://analythical.com/blog/data-visualization-sins) is a walk-through on how not to confuse your audience. It explains the use of colour and secondary axes in Microsoft Excel plots.

If you are interested in learning more about fonts, [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) is a great place to start. If you're interested in choosing a font for a website, have a look at [Google's free fonts here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato#standard-styles).

![Lato is a free Google font](images/google-fonts.png)

[This page](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html) from the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html) gives a breakdown of the `RcolorBrewer` package and when to use its different sets of palettes.

![](images/palettes.PNG)

[The color brewer webpage](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=PuOr&n=4) gives fantastic advice on how to choose colours for maps, using the same theory as the package above. It also gives you the hex codes for each colour that you may copy to use yourself.

![](images/colour-map.PNG)


[This video on colour theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiD6etOB6qI) is a useful primer on colour in data viz.

[Econometrics in R]{.panel-name}

# If you're looking to implement econometric techqniques in R

[Grant McDermott's Data science for economists course](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) is a great place to start. He has [one lecture](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/08-regression/08-regression.html) on Regression that is super useful.

[R Shiny]{.panel-name}

# If you're looking to make interactive web pages with R and R Markdown

The simplest way to get a quick and dirty interactive dashboard together is to use the `flexdashboard` package. [Here is a link](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) to the package. One of the great advantages of `flexdashboard` is that you can get amazing interactivity with just `htmlwidgets`, you do not need to use a shiny-runtime. In other words, you can create and host a static html page anywhere, for example on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

![Flexdashboard](images/flexdashboard.PNG)

If you want more interactivity, David Robinson's video on global crop yields shows a simple Shiny app, with code [here](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts/blob/master/crop-yields-shiny/app.Rmd).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uqAhIiK9Rc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Another video example of R Shiny comes from [Andrew Couch's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoCgToAuzsU).

[Recreating Published Figures]{.panel-name}

# When you can't get the authors of an article to share their data

Sometimes you may want to recreate a figure for your own paper from a journal article, but the data is not publicly accessible.

One option is to snip the image from the article and cite it in your own. The disadvantage of this is that the figure will not fit your colour scheme and may be horribly pixalated.

An alternative is to recreate the figure yourself by extracting the data from the image.

A truly fantastic free tool for this purpose is [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). This web application allows you to upload a figure and grab the data from it.
