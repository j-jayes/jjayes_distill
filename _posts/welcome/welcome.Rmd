This is a line from Interlude One off of Alt-J's first album, An Awesome Wave. I like this lyric a great deal!

I aspire to balance in my own life. This site is a space to share what I find interesting, and encourage me to keep learning and sharing. It includes exploratory data analyses, R tutorials, and answers to some data specific questions. I hope that you enjoy your look around.
