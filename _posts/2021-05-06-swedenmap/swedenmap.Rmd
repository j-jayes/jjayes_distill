## What was the relationship between population and regional GDP in Sweden in 1571?

### Scatter plot and interactive map

The scatter plot below shows the relationship between population in the Swedish counties in 1571 (x-axis) and regional GDP share (y-axis). 

Hovering over a point shows the name of the county, and highlights its location on the map of Sweden to the right (shown with their current borders).

Clicking on a county on the map will take you to it's page on [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

```{r}
sweden_scatter <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pop, GDP_share)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
   geom_point_interactive(
    aes(
      tooltip = lan_namn,
      data_id = lan_namn
    ),
    na.rm = TRUE, size = 6,
    shape = 21,
    color = "#0072B2", fill = "#0072B280"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
  labs(x = "Population in the Swedish counties in 1571",
       y = "Regional GDP share") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```


```{r}
girafe(
  ggobj = plot_grid(sweden_scatter, s_map, rel_widths = c(1.2, 1)),
  width_svg = 10,
  height_svg = 8,
  options = list(
    # opts_tooltip(css = tooltip_css, delay_mouseover = 0, delay_mouseout = 0),
    opts_hover(css = "fill: #E69F00; fill-opacity: 1.0; stroke: #E69F00;")
  )
)

```

### What do we learn?

In the scatter plot above we can see that the two northernmost counties, though large in land are are very sparsely populated. The line of best fit shows that Västmanland County has a high relative share of GDP compared to it's population, and that Kalmar Län has a high population to it's share of GDP in 1571.
