This repo hosts the content of my data blog which you can access at [Interludeone.com](https://interludeone.com "Interlude One")


This site is a space to share what I find interesting, and encourage me to keep learning and sharing. It includes exploratory data analyses, R tutorials, and answers to some data specific questions. I hope that you enjoy your look around.
